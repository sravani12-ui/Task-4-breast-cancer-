# Task 7: Support Vector Machine (SVM) – AI & ML

## 🎯 Objective
To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification using scikit-learn and evaluate its performance.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `Task7_SVM.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of SVM for classification.

## 📌 Key Components
- Importing required libraries
- Loading and understanding the dataset
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) from `sklearn`
- Model evaluation:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Visualization of results (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for plots)
